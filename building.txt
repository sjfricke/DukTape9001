To build this project, 
you must have the repository's directory (DukTape9001) inside of a 
"repo" folder, which is inside of some other directory (say, "AnimeReal")
which contains a copy of the "openpose" directory for the OpenPose repository

So the directory structure should be

AnimeReal
    repo
        DukTape9001
    openpose

Yes, this is hacky, but it's a quick way to ensure we don't need to fiddle
around with makefiles and stuff

run desktop_build.sh to build the desktop program, 
and desktop_run.sh to run it
